# PersonalWebsite

My personal **deprecated** website for professional purposes. This is the classic
bootstrap.js-looking design that everybody goes for, but I've since gone for something that
speaks more to me. I'm keeping this up for the memories.

Current iteration of the website is here:
https://github.com/jeraguilon/jeraguilon.github.io
