				  			Currently I'm a second year in Georgia Tech's Computer Science program, set to graduate May 2018. I self-taught myself Java out of curiosity in high school and have been hooked since. <br>
				  			<br>If I had to pick my favorite personal project, it's hands down my Icon-Based Asthma Action Plan, which I did for research out in Tech Square. As somebody who was constantly troubled by the disease, I find value in knowing that my work could measurably improve the lives of others around me. <br>
				  			<br>I have a lot of uncommon interests, but my best "party trick" is the fact that by the time you finish reading this sentence, I could have solved an entire Rubik's Cube.

			  				Asthma is a chronic condition that afflicts 8.6% of all children, with a higher rate for those of low socioeconomic status. One of the most effective ways for parents to manage their childrens' asthma is through an Asthma Action Plan. Research has shown that icon-based plans have improved the health care management of those with lower reading comprehension. My role under <a href=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/rosa-arriaga>Dr. Rosa Arriaga</a> was to implement the backend of the IBAAP with the front end prototype.

I helped integrate an array of cloud storage management solutions that are being implemented across all of the company's products. I also contributed to the initiative of providing high quality unit and end-to-end tests across the entire platform.

			  				The initiative of the Outreach Program at Georgia Tech is to facilitate computational learning in disadvantaged areas in Atlanta. As a tutor, I got to introduce middle schoolers to functional programming, a term I had never even heard of at their age. By working weekly with these kids, I really got to understand how accessible, enjoyable, and fulfilling programming can be for people of all walks of life.
